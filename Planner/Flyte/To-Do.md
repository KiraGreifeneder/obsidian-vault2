## Now
- [x] Implement core functionality of previous prototype
	- [x] Modules 
- [x] How the hell should we keep the data types? string per default? string or number and try to handle both cases?

## Soon
- [x] Remove mock server, create mock data hub
- [ ] Figma/Penpot concept
	- [ ] In parallel: Create Config, Update, and Debug stuff (Refer to PowerPoint)
- [ ] Create a technical concept for controlling the motors, and doing the wifi config
- [ ] Decision making: what modules do we really need in the tabs as a normal user, what should be hidden away in the debugging menu or modals.
	- Respect the user lifecycle - tabs should reflect the scheme of Config - Sailing - After Sailing -> calibrate/config - profiles - data. Look at Cura for inspiration
- [x] flyte test server that sends mock data
	- [ ] http polling keep-alive
