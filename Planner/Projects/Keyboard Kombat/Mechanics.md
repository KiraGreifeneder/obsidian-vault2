ChatGPT was kind enough to give me a full run-down on how to possibly balance the scoring etc.

Creating a balanced turn-based fighting game where typing speed and complexity of attacks determine damage requires careful consideration of mechanics to ensure the game is both fair and enjoyable. Here’s a structured approach:

---

### **Core Components**

1. **Typing Speed Scoring**:
    
    - Measure typing speed in Words Per Minute (WPM) or Characters Per Second (CPS).
    - Add penalties for typos or inaccuracies (e.g., subtract points for each incorrect letter).
2. **Attack Complexity**:
    
    - Assign difficulty levels to each attack (e.g., "light," "medium," "heavy").
    - More complex attacks should involve longer or harder-to-type phrases but yield higher damage potential.
3. **Balancing Typing Speed and Complexity**:
    
    - Use a formula to calculate damage that considers: Damage=(Typing Speed Modifier)×(Attack Complexity Modifier)×(Accuracy)\text{Damage} = (\text{Typing Speed Modifier}) \times (\text{Attack Complexity Modifier}) \times (\text{Accuracy})Damage=(Typing Speed Modifier)×(Attack Complexity Modifier)×(Accuracy)

### **Balancing Mechanics**

1. **Attack Complexity Modifier**:
    
    - Assign values based on word length or difficulty:
        - Light Attack: Short, common words (e.g., 5–7 characters).
        - Medium Attack: Medium phrases or technical words (e.g., 10–15 characters).
        - Heavy Attack: Long sentences or difficult words (e.g., 20+ characters).
    - Example Modifier Values: Light = 1.0, Medium = 1.5, Heavy = 2.0.
2. **Typing Speed Modifier**:
    
    - Use a curve to ensure that players with average speed can still compete, but faster typists are rewarded. For example:
        - Below 40 WPM: 0.8x multiplier.
        - 40–60 WPM: 1.0x multiplier.
        - 60–80 WPM: 1.2x multiplier.
        - Above 80 WPM: 1.4x multiplier.
3. **Accuracy**:
    
    - Scale damage based on percentage accuracy: Accuracy Modifier=Correct CharactersTotal Characters\text{Accuracy Modifier} = \frac{\text{Correct Characters}}{\text{Total Characters}}Accuracy Modifier=Total CharactersCorrect Characters​
    - Encourage precision to offset speed advantages.
4. **Cooldown System**:
    
    - Heavier attacks require more time before the next turn, preventing players from spamming high-damage moves without consequence.
    - Example Cooldowns:
        - Light: 1 turn.
        - Medium: 2 turns.
        - Heavy: 3 turns.
5. **Critical Hits**:
    
    - Reward players who type a phrase perfectly (100% accuracy) or within a very short time frame with a critical hit bonus (e.g., +20% damage).
6. **Opponent Defense**:
    
    - Introduce defensive mechanics, such as evasion or mitigation, which are influenced by their own typing performance during a "defense phase."

### **Example Workflow**

1. **Player Turn**:
    
    - Player selects an attack type.
    - A prompt appears (e.g., "Heavy Attack: 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'").
    - Typing performance is measured (speed, accuracy).
    - Damage is calculated using the formula and modifiers.
2. **Opponent Turn**:
    
    - Opponent selects an attack.
    - Player enters a defense phase (e.g., type to reduce incoming damage).
3. **Turn Resolution**:
    
    - Apply damage and resolve effects (e.g., cooldowns, debuffs).

### **Playtesting and Fine-Tuning**

1. **Collect Player Data**:
    
    - Track typing speeds, accuracy rates, and attack success rates across different players.
    - Identify imbalances where one strategy (e.g., spamming light attacks) is overly effective.
2. **Adjust Modifier Values**:
    
    - Test different scaling for speed, accuracy, and attack complexity.
    - Ensure no single attribute (speed or complexity) overwhelmingly determines success.
3. **Dynamic Difficulty**:
    
    - Adjust prompts based on player skill (e.g., harder phrases for faster typists).

---

### **Optional Enhancements**

1. **Special Abilities**:
    
    - Include abilities that trigger under specific conditions (e.g., a "charged attack" after typing a phrase perfectly three times in a row).
2. **Multiplayer Balance**:
    
    - Implement matchmaking based on typing skill levels to ensure fair competition.
3. **Customization**:
    
    - Allow players to choose their “fighter,” each with unique traits that slightly alter typing mechanics (e.g., faster cooldowns, more damage on perfect accuracy).

This approach provides a balanced gameplay experience where players are rewarded for both speed and precision, while also considering strategic depth through attack selection and cooldown management.
