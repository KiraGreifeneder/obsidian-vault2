Dear null,

[[Kira]] is so cute and lovable. I always miss her when she goes to work. Because of her I strive to be the best person I can be. She's a great role model to me. I think she still loves me despite my many mistakes and I am soooo incredibly grateful for that. She is the center of my life and I love her so much. [[Kira]] is also great at just about everything she does. Her drawings are amazing. She is really talented in music. Learning new things is a breeze for her and she does it constantly. Currently she is doing PHP at work. PHP!? I would not dare touching that with a two meter pole, but she has the grips to do it. [[Kira]] is very special to me. One might even say she is my skeleton key. Anyway it is getting late. Got to do laundry because we do not have socks anymore.

P.S. I love how she wears my stuff like all the time. Seeing her in it makes me happy because to me it seems like she wants to feel close to me and wearing my clothes makes her feel this way. I also like wearing the stuff she gives me for the same reason.
