Oh I thought - I'd had enough
Thought I'd lay - off for a while
Focus - on being so tough
But when I saw you - smile

How could someone capture 
my attention
All these fears
Had one exemption 

I just had to try anew

you're my perfect partner in crime
We'll be together under stormy skies
And we play video games all day
and you'll ask me if I'm sure I wanna stay

you don't have to ask twice

and I've never felt stronger
never wanted life to last longer
never wanted to work harder

The closeness of you I feel in every fibre of your sweater
I'll take the walk over to yours that'll make my day much better
Because you 
feel like home
I never wanna be alone - again

We can study all day all night
celebrate the semester getting takeout and
