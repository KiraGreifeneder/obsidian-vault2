G CM7 G D CM7 G

     Csus2 G Csus2
Whoo!

[Verse 1]
G                      GM7
Overwhelming thought of being on my own
              Am                                C
For two weeks straight without the sight of you around
G                      GM7
Overwhelming thought of if this lasts forever
          Am                          C     G
If you'll find ways to remember me somehow

[Chorus]
      Em        C
I hope you know
                     G
Everything you do is
       Em     C
Special to me
                    G    C
You're my skeleton key

[Verse 2]
                       G       CM7
So do you even have to ask me? (Ooh)
             GM7 CM7                G   CM7
You know that I want to be there with you (Ooh)
GM7 CM7             G   CM7
I wanna be there with you (Ooh)

G Csus2 G Csus2 G Csus2 G

[Chorus]
      Em       C
I hope you know
                    G
Everything you do is
      Em     C
Special to me
                    G
You're my skeleton key
      Em       C
I hope you know
                    G
Everything you do is
       Em    C
Special to me
                    G
You're my skeleton key
