[Intro]
BM7  G#7   C#m7   F#7
D#m7   G#7   C#m7   F#13

[Verse 1]
B         G#m        C#m7      F#7
Maybe one day I will fall in a bookstore
B        Ddim7     C#m7      F#7
Into the arms of a guy
      A#         G7b9
We’ll sneak into bars
    C#m7
And gaze at the stars
F#7sus     F#7    BM7   F#7
Surrounded by fireflies


[Verse 2]
    B          G#7            C#m7      F#7
Oh, I’d like to sleep in till two on a Sunday
    B             Ddim7     C#m7   F#7
And listen to the bluebirds sigh
    BM7           G#7
Get soaked in the rain
    C#m7
And smile through the pain
F#7sus     F#7          BM7 B7
Slow dance under stormy skies


[Chorus]
EM7            Em6
Maybe I’m just old fashioned
D#m7                G#7b5  G#7
Read too many fairytales
C#m7                        Em7
It’s no wonder I’ve had no luck
D#m7            Ab7(b5)    G#7
No one’s ever good enough
C#m7      D#m7            G#m7         C#7
I want a love like I’ve seen in the movies
C#m7        F#7             BM7     D#m7  Dm7
That’s why I’ll never fall in love
