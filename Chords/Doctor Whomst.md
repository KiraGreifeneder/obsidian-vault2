C F C F
D F


[Verse]
                              C
Oh my God, I feel just how I used to feel
F                              C
Watching Danny Phantom, eating Happy Meals
F                              C
Every night at seven, watch my favorite shows
F                              G                   F
Never really worried 'bout the to and fro's of the way life goes


[Pre-Chorus]
            Am    G            F          C
It's like a time machine just brought me there
       G       F
Wiped away my thoughts and cares
     Am      G       F        C
And re-embraced the daylight there
    D       F
Or maybe, just maybe


[Chorus]
            C                  F
I think I'm starting to like myself
            Am                    C
I think I'm right where I need to be
          C                  F
To be the best version of myself
          C                          Am
To be the version that I want you to see
            C                         G
Oh, oh, oh, I feel like I found the secret
F             C
I knew that I just can't keep it
D                                    F
Bottled inside, I can no longer hide what I feel
                      C
Every single goddamn day


[Instrumental Break]
C F C F
C F F* Am


[Chorus]
            C                  F
I think I'm starting to like myself
            Am                    C
I think I'm right where I need to be
          C                  F
To be the best version of myself
          C                          Am
To be the version that I want you to see
            C                         G
Oh, oh, oh, I feel like I found the secret
F             C
I knew that I just can't keep it
D                                    F
Bottled inside, I can no longer hide what I feel
                      C
Every single goddamn day
