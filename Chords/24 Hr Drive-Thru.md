Cmaj7 D G (x3)
Cmaj7 D


[Verse]

G             C                   G
I know it's a little bit late for fast food
         C                      G
And it's raining like a goddamn monsoon
              C
But I haven't seen you in days and
A                          D
Someone has gotta snap you out of this phase


[Pre-Chorus]

N.C.              G      C       Em
Because you're sad, alone, and no one's home
D      G                       C  D
And it doesn't have to be that way
            G       C            Em
So just call my home from your mobile phone
D       C                    Cmaj7
And you already know what to say


[Chorus]

N.C.                  G C  Em D
All you need to do is call me
              G          C         Em D
And I'll take Kenilworth Avenue to 193
          G    C           Em          D
And we can get fries under dark stormy skies
              A           C          Cmaj7
And we'll run thunder and lightning away

N.C.                   G  C  Em D
I'll text you when I'm on my way
            G       C
I'll do whatever it takes
                  Em          D
Drive through the thunder and rain so we can
G    C          Em        D
Fill up both of our water cups
         A               C           Cmaj7
With Dr. Pepper and then act like we paid


[Bridge]

         G7   Cmaj7
It'll be okay
         G7   Cmaj7
It'll be okay
       G7     Cmaj7
Okay! Okay!

G7 Cmaj7

G7             Cmaj7
Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh

G7             Cmaj7
Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh


[Pre-Chorus]

N.C.              G      C       Em
Because you're sad, alone, and no one's home
D      G                       C  D
And it doesn't have to be that way
            G       C            Em
So just call my home from your mobile phone
D       C                    Cmaj7
And you already know what to say


[Chorus]

N.C.                  G C  Em D
All you need to do is call me
              G          C         Em D
And I'll take Kenilworth Avenue to 193
          G    C           Em          D
And we can get fries under dark stormy skies
              A           C          Cmaj7
And we'll run thunder and lightning away

N.C.                   G  C  Em D
I'll text you when I'm on my way
            G       C
I'll do whatever it takes
                  Em          D
Drive through the thunder and rain so we can
G    C          Em        D
Fill up both of our water cups
         A               C           Cmaj7
With Dr. Pepper and then act like we paid (ooh)


[Outro]

         G7
It'll be okay (okay)
