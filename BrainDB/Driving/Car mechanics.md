When learning how to drive, knowing how the car itself works is most likely very helpful for understanding why things need to be done. It also makes it more difficult to forget what you have learned. I have therefore compiled small tidbits of information that may be useful.

## Clutch
We need a clutch because the motor always turns, but the wheels do not. 

For example, before we [start](#Starting%20on%20a%20hill), we keep the clutch de-coupled so that the motor isn't connected to the wheels, and we therefore don't start moving. Using the brakes alone would force the motor to work against them, which kills it.

The mechanism is made up of a clutch wheel pressing up against a fly wheel, that friction is what "sets" it. The fly wheel connects to the engine, the clutch plate connects to the [Transmission](#Transmission). When you move your foot off the clutch pedal, springs push the pressure plate against the clutch disk, which in turn presses against the flywheel. This is how the engine is locked against the transmission input shaft, causing them to spin at the same speed.
### Engaging and releasing

## Transmission
## Starting on a hill
The car, and bt extension the wheels, want to roll backwards when you are on a hill. The steps to start are as follows:

- Start with the handbrake up, or if it's a very small incline move off of the brakes. Full pressure on the clutch pedal.
- With a a tiny bit of pressure on the gas pedal, slowly release the clutch pedal until the "sweet spot" is reached. 
- Keep this position on both pedals until the car stops reversing and moves forward.
