SR stands for Switch Row, SC stands for switch column. The switch has two of each, so we can wire up the pcbs in rows and columns. I.e. SR0 will go to pcb on its left, SR1 will go to the pcb on its right. Top and bottom for SC0 and SC1. the L- ones are for LEDs.

Each PCB needs ONE diode, (SOD-123 I believe)?. Other than the Diode and the connections to the other PCBs, we need no other connections. The ends of each row and column are then connected to the numbered pins on the board. 

Measurements of the amoeba: 
W: 1.89 cm
L: 1.65cm
H (pcb only): 0.17cm
H (with diode): 0.29mm
