In a circuit, we need to be able to tell clearly if a signal is high or low. When it is difficult to determine from the voltage, it is a phenomenon called _floating_. Therefore, we can add resistors to clarify this state.

> Note: pull-down resistors are also needed sometimes, but are less common.

Pull-up resistors are connected to the high voltage (VCC), whereas pull-down resistors are connected to Ground. (At least) the former is often connected to buttons to.
