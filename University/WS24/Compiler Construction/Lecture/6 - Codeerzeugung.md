## Summary/Notes
stack machine vs register machine: stack machine is slower, but we don't need to remember which register holds what etc... just add to stack, which is easier.
### UE P.5. (1) notes
estack - expression stack, temporary expressions stored here
static/data area - plain array, points to heap addr.
- stores global variables
heap
- storing objects andn their fields
code - byte array
- stores our instructions
- this is where our code generator puts instructions
- pc counts to index in here
pstack - method stack
- contains locals and return addresses
- 
- has function/frame pointer and stack pointer
	- between stack and frame pointer are local variables

Instructions

Eselsbr체cke: lokal Variablen sind "n채her" dran, daher verwenden diese den k체rzeren Befehl (load). Statische Variablen sind "weiter weg", und haben daher l채ngere Befehle (getStatic, putStatic).

getStatic puts a variable on the expression stack.

For the #compilerbau-exam, look at this video! Learn what instructions need how many bytes. Each instruction one byte, const w has 8 bytes total, const_n only 1, getStatic needs 3...

Here, load(y) loads y onto the expression stack?

And here, load(y) is loaded onto the expression stack again just in case...
![200](_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020241221162410.png)
If that first load(y) wasn't there, Expr() wouldn't be able to load y from the expression stack, because it's never been used in an expression before.
