## Instructions
- **Each team** must create a class diagram of the system, including the classes, their properties, operations (methods) and relationships.  
- **Each member** of the team must create two sequence diagrams of two supporting use cases from the Dronology data set (except for SC11). **That means a team of 5 must have 10 sequence diagrams.** 
- **Each team** must create a state-machine diagram that relates to at least one of the supporting case describing the states of a UAV. **Make sure to identify for which supporting case(s) the state-machine is based on.** 
- Make sure that, within the same team, **everyone uses two different supporting use cases to create the sequence diagrams**.

Hand-in procedure

- One member of the team must upload on Moodle a single PDF file containing the class diagram, one state-machine diagram and two sequence diagrams for each member of the team
- All elements of the sequence diagrams and state-machine diagram must be in the class diagram (same classes, methods and relationships)
- **Do not select SC11 to create a sequence diagram**

Grading Criteria

- Correctness - use the UML notation correctly
- Completeness - no missing elements in the diagrams
- Class diagram = 40% of the grade (same grade for the whole team)
- Sequence diagrams = 40% of the grade (same grade for the whole team)
- State-machine diagram = 20% of the grade (same grade for the whole team)
