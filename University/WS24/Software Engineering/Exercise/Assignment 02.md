## Instructions
This exercise's goal is to understand the different EARS requirement types and create trace links between requirements and use cases. 

This exercise consists of two parts:

- **E2.1 EARS type classification (50% of the grade)**
- In the first part of the exercise, you must classify the correct EARS type (see lecture slides for a reminder of the different types) for each of the given Requirements in the dronology dataset.
- Note that some of the requirements might fit into multiple EARS types. All the types should be listed for those. 
- **E2.2 Establishing trace links between Use Cases and Requirements (50% of the grade)**
- In the second part of the exercise, you should find the trace links between the requirements and use cases. For that, you mark which of them are linked to the given Use Cases (**Mark them with "X" if there is a link and "-" for no link**). 
- Supporting use cases **DO NOT** need to be traced.
- If the group consists of less than five members, you only have to link the requirements to the Use Cases you decided to use in the previous exercise, e.g., if you used use cases 1–3 during the last exercise, you only have to find the traces between the requirements and use cases 1–3. 
- Please mark those use cases for the tutor to correctly grade. 

If you are unsure about certain trace links between the requirements and use cases, you can add an optional description of why your group thinks those use cases are linked to a given requirement, which we take into account during the grading.

**Note that no points will be deducted if the comments are missing and the traces are correct.**

**Please note:** This is a group submission.

Submit your file containing your teams traces and EARS classification. Make sure it is in the PDF, XSLX, ODS, or other accepted format. Use the provided csv file as a base.
