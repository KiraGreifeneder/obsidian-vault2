## Lecture material
#software-eng-todo 
## Summary/Notes
Question types:
- Preferably questions of practical nature (Requirements, design modelling...)
- Give brief justifications if you believe there are options
- We'll only have to draw the diagrams we did in the UE, basically
- Only bring blank paper, pencil, and the student ID
- Fairly relaxed syntax in the UML diagrams. Emphasis on content, not syntax.
