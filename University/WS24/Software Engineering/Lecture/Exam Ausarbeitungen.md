## Exam 1
![](_attachments/SoftEng19-20.pdf)
### 1.a.
Implementation level, as we are most likely looking at the actual functions to be implemented. We can see what classes call another function (dashed arrow with call annotation). THen we have compositions, for example one motor is part of one cage. There is also an aggregation: FloorButtonAllocation is part of the cage. Both functions and fields are defined in the different classes.
### 1.b.
We are missing actors, interactions, sequences etc... This doesn't tell us anything about stakeholders or how someone should interact with the system.
### 1.c.
